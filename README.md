# MC-Textures-Randomizer
Textures Randomizer for Minecraft. Does exactly what you think it does.

So how does it work ?

First, you have to have Python 3 or higher.
If you don't have it, get it here : https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then, you just have to download the zip and extract everything in the same folder.
After, just extract and drag the desired textures folder (blocks, items...) from the desired Minecraft version (how to here : https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/215530) or the ressource pack, and put them in the textures folder of the randomizer.

You can have multiple textures subfolder (e.g: textures\blocks, textures\blocks(1), textures\items32x32, ...)

Finally, just click and run TextureRandomizer.py and let the magic happen.
You will be able to find the newly created ressource pack in the new_ressources folder.
You can always look into the rand.py and add textures to the blacklist section in the code.

I may or may not have future plans with this. Use at your own risk (jk jk, what could really happen with minecraft textures... right?)

Have fun!
