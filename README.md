# MC-Textures-Randomizer
Textures Randomizer for Minecraft. Does exactly what you think it does.

So how does it work ?

First, you have to have Python 3 or higher.
If you don't have it, get it here : https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then, you just have to download the zip and extract everything in the same folder.
After, just extract and drag the desired textures folder (blocks, items...) from the desired Minecraft version (how to here : https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/215530) or the resource pack, and put them in the textures folder of the randomizer.

You can have multiple textures subfolder (e.g: textures\blocks, textures\blocks(1), textures\items32x32, ...) but you can only randomize one (for now).

You can also edit the blacklist.txt and put the textures you want to blacklist in here.

Finally, just click and run TextureRandomizer.py and let the magic happen.
You will be able to find the newly created resource pack in the new_resources folder.

I may or may not have future plans with this. Use at your own risk (jk jk, what could really happen with minecraft textures... right?)

Have fun!
