# MC-Textures-Randomizer
Textures Randomizer for Minecraft. Works exactly the way you think it does.

So how does it work then?

First, you have to have Python 3 or higher.
If you don't have it, get it here : https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then, you just have to download the pack.mcmeta and the rand.py file and put them in the same folder of a textures folder.

Next, just click and run rand.py and let the magic happen.
You can always look into the rand.py and add textures to the blacklist section in the code.

I may or may not have future plans with it. Use at your own risk (jk jk, what could really happen with minecraft textures... right?)

Have fun!
