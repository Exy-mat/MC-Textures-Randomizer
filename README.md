# MC-Textures-Randomizer
Textures Randomizer for Minecraft. Does exactly what you think it does.

So how does it work ?

First, you have to have Python 3 or higher.
If you don't have it, get it here : https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then, you just have to download the whole thing and put them in the same folder.
Just extract and drag the blocks textures from the desired Minecraft version (how to here : https://gaming.stackexchange.com/a/215530) and put them in the textures/blocks/ folder of the randomizer.

Do not forget to edit the pack.mcmeta for it to work with the Minecraft version you want to use it for (versions can be found here : https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Creating_a_resource_pack)

Next, just click and run rand.py and let the magic happen.
You will be able to find the newly created ressource pack in the new_ressources folder.
You can always look into the rand.py and add textures to the blacklist section in the code.

I may or may not have future plans with this. Use at your own risk (jk jk, what could really happen with minecraft textures... right?)

Have fun!
